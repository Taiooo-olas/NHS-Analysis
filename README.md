# NHS Healthcare analysis - Project Overview


## The goal of this project is to investigate the allocation of resources to the various sectors. To glean insight into how to appropriate practitioners across the NHS.

#### Founded in 1948, the National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded healthcare system of the United Kingdom, serving millions of patients across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Over the decades, the NHS has continually adapted to meet the evolving healthcare needs of the population, launching numerous initiatives to improve patient care and health outcomes. To enhance its services and outreach, the NHS has hired a new data analytics team to evaluate the effectiveness of these campaigns and their impact on patient engagement and health outcomes. The insights gained will help allocate the budget more effectively to achieve two primary objectives: increasing public engagement and utilization of NHS services, and raising awareness of the NHS's offerings and its commitment to public health across the UK. With these strategic efforts, the NHS aims to enhance patient care and foster a more informed and health-conscious society, ensuring access to necessary medical care for all.

Dataset Structure
The dataset consisted of three tables, including information about campaigns, signups and user demographics, as well as claims filed by customers and related claim information.

The project's focus was to determine the allocation of services and which services should require more than the other. Hence the project concentrated on these factors.

To evaluate campaign performance, we focused on the following key aspects:

1. Which types of appointments (by mode and status) have the highest demand, and how does this vary across different regions?

-> Purpose: Identify which appointment modes (e.g., Face-to-Face, Telephone, Online) and statuses (e.g., Attended, DNA, Cancelled) are most frequently used and needed across different geographic regions.

-> Insight: This will help in understanding which services are most in demand and may need more resources or attention.

2. How does the time between booking and appointment impact the appointment status and overall patient attendance?
   
-> Purpose: Analyze the relationship between the time from booking to the appointment and whether appointments are attended, missed, or cancelled.

-> Insight: This can help in optimizing appointment scheduling to improve attendance rates and reduce cancellations.

3. What is the distribution of appointment durations (e.g., 6-10 minutes, 21-30 minutes) and how does it correlate with appointment status and healthcare professional types?

-> Purpose: Understand how the duration of appointments affects their status and the type of healthcare professional involved.
-> Insight: This can provide insights into the efficiency of different appointment types and help in resource allocation for various appointment lengths.

4. Are there significant differences in appointment demand and type based on healthcare professional type and availability?

-> Purpose: Explore how different healthcare professional types (e.g., GP, Other Practice Staff) are utilized and whether there is a need for more professionals in specific categories.

-> Insight: This will help in planning staffing needs and ensuring that the right types of healthcare professionals are available to meet appointment demands.
5. What patterns can be observed in appointment data across different months, and how do these patterns inform seasonal or time-based resource allocation?

6. What are the five locations with the highest number of records?
