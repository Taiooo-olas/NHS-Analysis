# NHS Healthcare analysis - Project Overview


## The goal of this project is to investigate the allocation of resources to the various sectors. To glean insight into how to appropriate practitioners across the NHS.

#### Founded in 1948, the National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded healthcare system of the United Kingdom, serving millions of patients across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Over the decades, the NHS has continually adapted to meet the evolving healthcare needs of the population, launching numerous initiatives to improve patient care and health outcomes. Recently, the NHS introduced various marketing campaigns aimed at promoting public health, enhancing service visibility, and encouraging preventive care. These campaigns cover a wide range of topics, including wellness tips, the importance of vaccinations, and mental health services. To enhance its services and outreach, the NHS has hired a new data analytics team to evaluate the effectiveness of these campaigns and their impact on patient engagement and health outcomes. The insights gained will help allocate the budget more effectively to achieve two primary objectives: increasing public engagement and utilization of NHS services, and raising awareness of the NHS's offerings and its commitment to public health across the UK. With these strategic efforts, the NHS aims to enhance patient care and foster a more informed and health-conscious society, ensuring access to necessary medical care for all.
