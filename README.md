# NHS Healthcare analysis - Project Overview


#### The goal of this project is to investigate the allocation of resources to the various sectors.

Founded in 1948, the National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly funded healthcare system of the United Kingdom, serving millions of patients across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. To enhance its services and outreach, the NHS has hired a new data analytics team to evaluate the effectiveness of these campaigns and their impact on patient engagement and health outcomes.

## The project's focus was to determine the allocation of services and to evaluate campaign performance, 

We focused on the following key aspects:

#### 1. Which types of appointments (by mode and status) have the highest demand, and how does this vary across different regions?

#### 2. How does the time between booking and appointment impact the appointment status and overall patient attendance?

#### 3. What is the distribution of appointment durations (e.g., 6-10 minutes, 21-30 minutes) and how does it correlate with appointment status and healthcare professional types?

#### 4. Are there significant differences in appointment demand and type based on healthcare professional type and availability?

#### 5. What patterns can be observed in appointment data across different months, and how do these patterns inform seasonal or time-based resource allocation?

#### 6. What are the five locations with the highest number of records?
